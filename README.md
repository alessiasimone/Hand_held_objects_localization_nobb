# Hand held objects localization
This report comes from a Kaggle competition among students of the University of Catania for the course of Knowledge Discovery. \
The task consists on classify eight different types of hand-held objects with a distribution shift: background of class "0" 
was the same for all images, instead of other classes. \
My approach consists on an accurate image preprocessing in order to remove the distribution shift, and the application of an Inception Network architecture, 
without the usage of bounding boxes.
